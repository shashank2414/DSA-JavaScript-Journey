ðŸš€ Day 12 â€“ Applied Recursion in Project Development
âœ… Problem Solved in Project:
â€¢ Recursive Directory Traversal for Processing Files (Project Feature)

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Problem Context:
While working on my project, I needed to process all files in a nested directory structure (e.g., reading uploads, scanning reports, or parsing configuration files).
Since folders could have subfolders at multiple levels, recursion was the natural choice.

ðŸ”‘ Recursive Approach:
â€¢ Base case â€“ Stop when no more subdirectories or files are found
â€¢ Recursive case â€“ For every folder, explore its contents, and if an item is a folder, call the function again on it
â€¢ This allowed me to handle any depth of nesting without hardcoding levels

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Saw recursion in action beyond DSA problems â€” applied it to real project requirements
â€¢ Understood how recursion mirrors tree-like structures (folders/files)
â€¢ Learned to combine recursion with file system APIs to make the logic both dynamic and reusable

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
If your data has a hierarchical structure (like menus, categories, directories, or comments), recursion often gives you the cleanest and most scalable solution.
