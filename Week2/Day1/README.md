ðŸš€ Day 8 â€“ Introduction to Recursion
âœ… Progress:
â€¢ Started with the fundamentals of recursion
â€¢ Understood the concept of base case and recursive case
â€¢ Performed dry runs on basic recursion problems to grasp the call stack flow

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
Every recursive function must have:

Base Case â€“ The condition to stop recursion

Recursive Case â€“ The part where the function calls itself

ðŸŒ€ Dry Runs Done On:
â€¢ Factorial
â€¢ Sum of N numbers
â€¢ Basic array traversal using recursion
â€¢ Printing numbers from N to 1 and 1 to N

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Understood how function calls are pushed and popped from the call stack
â€¢ Realized the importance of writing a correct base case to avoid infinite recursion
â€¢ Got comfortable tracing recursion manually through dry runs

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Always design the base case first â€” it's your anchor to stop recursion from going infinite.
