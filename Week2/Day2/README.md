🚀 Day 9 – Recursion + Intro to Backtracking
✅ Problems Solved:
• Factorial using Recursion
• Fibonacci Sequence using Recursion
• Sum of First N Natural Numbers using Recursion

🧠 Revise your logic

🔑 Factorial (n!)
• Recursive definition: n! = n * (n-1)!
• Base case: 0! = 1
• Practiced tracing recursive calls and returning values step-by-step.

🔑 Fibonacci Series:
• Recursive definition: fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
• Base case: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1
• Learned about overlapping subproblems and the need for memoization in real-world usage.

🔑 Sum of First N Natural Numbers:
• Recursive formula: sum(n) = n + sum(n-1)
• Base case: sum(0) = 0
• Reinforced understanding of recursive accumulation.

🌀 Introduction to Backtracking:
• Understood that backtracking is an extension of recursion.
• Key idea: Explore → Recurse → Undo (Backtrack)
• Example: Reversing decisions while exploring all possible paths (like in permutations or maze problems).

📌 Learnings:
• Gained confidence in recursive problem-solving.
• Learned how recursion builds up solutions and how backtracking helps in exploring multiple possibilities.
• Realized the importance of base cases and how recursion unfolds & folds.

💡 Tip of the Day:
Think of recursion as “going deeper”, and backtracking as “coming back to try another way.”
