ðŸš€ Day 14 â€“ Revision Day: Recursion, Arrays & Searching/Sorting Algorithms
âœ… Topics Revised:
â€¢ Recursion â€“ Concepts, base cases, recursive cases, call stack flow
â€¢ Arrays â€“ Traversals, in-place modifications, two-pointer techniques
â€¢ Searching Algorithms â€“ Linear Search, Binary Search
â€¢ Sorting Algorithms â€“ Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Recursion:
â€¢ Reviewed classic problems like factorial, Fibonacci, sum of numbers, array sum
â€¢ Revisited stack height optimizations (e.g., O(log n) power calculation)
â€¢ Reinforced understanding of backtracking basics

ðŸ”‘ Arrays:
â€¢ Practiced shifting elements (move zeroes, remove duplicates)
â€¢ Strengthened two-pointer strategies for optimization

ðŸ”‘ Searching:
â€¢ Compared Linear Search vs Binary Search performance and use cases
â€¢ Focused on how sorted data enables logarithmic search

ðŸ”‘ Sorting:
â€¢ Practiced basic sorts from scratch to reinforce logic
â€¢ Understood time complexities and when to use each algorithm

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Stronger grasp of foundational DSA concepts
â€¢ Clearer mental models for recursion and iterative solutions
â€¢ Better understanding of when to pick which algorithm for optimal performance

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Before learning advanced algorithms, master the basics â€” they form the foundation for everything else.
