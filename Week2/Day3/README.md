ðŸš€ Day 10 â€“ Recursion Practice: Array Sum & Power of 4
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Sum of All Numbers in an Array (using Recursion)
â€¢ Power of 4 â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Sum of All Numbers in an Array:
â€¢ Solved using recursion by reducing the problem size:
â€ƒsum(arr, n) = arr[n-1] + sum(arr, n-1)
â€¢ Base case: when the array is empty or has one element
â€¢ Practiced breaking down arrays recursively and building up the result

ðŸ”‘ Power of 4:
â€¢ Checked if a number is a power of 4 using:
â€ƒ1. Loop / Recursion
â€ƒ2. Bitwise & modulus logic
â€¢ Conditions:
â€ƒ- num > 0
â€ƒ- num & (num - 1) == 0 â†’ check if it's a power of 2
â€ƒ- num % 3 == 1 â†’ ensures it's a power of 4, not just power of 2
â€¢ Time: O(log n) if done recursively or iteratively

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Strengthened recursion by applying it to arrays
â€¢ Learned to recognize patterns in number powers
â€¢ Got more confident with base cases and recursive reductions

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Not all problems need loops â€” sometimes thinking recursively can lead to cleaner, more elegant solutions!
