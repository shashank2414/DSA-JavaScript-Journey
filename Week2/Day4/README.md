ðŸš€ Day 11 â€“ Power of X (Recursive Approaches)
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Power of X to the Power N â€“ Stack Height O(n)
â€¢ Power of X to the Power N â€“ Stack Height O(log n)

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Power (Stack Height O(n))
â€¢ Basic recursive approach:
â€ƒpower(x, n) = x * power(x, n-1)
â€¢ Base case: power(x, 0) = 1
â€¢ Stack height = O(n), straightforward but not optimal for large n

ðŸ”‘ Optimized Power (Stack Height O(log n))
â€¢ Used divide-and-conquer strategy (Exponentiation by Squaring):

if (n % 2 === 0)  
â€ƒpower(x, n) = power(x*x, n/2)  
else  
â€ƒpower(x, n) = x * power(x*x, (n-1)/2)
â€¢ Stack height = O(log n)
â€¢ More efficient, especially for large values of n

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Understood how recursion depth can impact performance
â€¢ Learned how mathematical optimization (squaring) reduces call stack size
â€¢ Practiced tracing recursion using dry runs and breaking down powers

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Always analyze if the recursion depth can be optimized â€” O(log n) solutions not only save space but also improve runtime significantly.
