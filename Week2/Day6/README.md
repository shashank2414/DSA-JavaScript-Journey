ðŸš€ Day 13 â€“ Factorial & Basics of Backtracking
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Factorial of n (using Recursion)
â€¢ Basics of Backtracking

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Factorial of n:
â€¢ Recursive formula: fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)
â€¢ Base case: fact(0) = 1
â€¢ Practiced tracing recursion calls and understanding stack frames in detail.

ðŸ”‘ Basics of Backtracking:
â€¢ Learned that backtracking is a problem-solving paradigm where you explore all possibilities but "undo" choices when they lead to invalid solutions.
â€¢ Key steps:
â€ƒ1. Choose â†’
â€ƒ2. Explore (Recursive Call) â†’
â€ƒ3. Unchoose (Backtrack)
â€¢ Common use cases: N-Queens, Maze Solving, Permutations, Subset Generation.

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Strengthened fundamentals of recursion with a classic factorial problem.
â€¢ Understood the flow of decisions and reversals in backtracking.
â€¢ Realized that backtracking is essentially recursion + decision undoing.

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Think of backtracking as exploring a maze â€” if one path is blocked, go back and try another.
