✅ Day 24 of DSA Journey – Tackling Palindrome & Queue Challenges

Today was all about problem-solving with a twist of real-world applications. Here’s what I accomplished:

🔍 What I Solved Today

✔ Palindrome Linked List – Checked if a linked list reads the same backward and forward. This problem really helped me strengthen my understanding of two-pointer techniques and in-place reversal.
✔ Queue Problem (Infosys Platform) – Practiced lexicographical order challenges using queues, which improved my ability to implement FIFO data structures efficiently.

📚 What I Learned

Two-Pointer Method for Palindrome detection without extra space.

How queue operations can be used for sorting and lexicographical problems.

The importance of time complexity when working with large datasets.

🔄 Revision Focus

Before moving forward, I revised:
✔ Basics of Linked List operations
✔ Queue vs Stack differences
✔ Complexity Analysis for reversal and traversal algorithms

💡 Tip of the Day:
When solving palindrome problems, avoid converting to an array or string if the question expects O(1) extra space. Instead, reverse the second half of the list and compare – super efficient!

🚀 Next Steps

Deep dive into Deque and Priority Queue problems

Start preparing for real-world graph and tree-based challenges
