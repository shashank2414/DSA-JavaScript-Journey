🚀 Day 23 of My 90 Days DSA with JavaScript Challenge! 💻🔥

Today’s journey was all about exploring real-world problems with Linked Lists and tackling some advanced operations.
Here’s what I accomplished:

✅ Explored how Linked Lists are used in real-world applications like:

Music playlists 🎵

Browser history navigation 🌐

Undo/Redo operations in text editors ✍️

✅ Solved an interesting problem:
🔹 Reverse Linked List II – Reversing a sublist of a linked list between two given positions.
👉 This one really tested my understanding of pointers and edge cases.

💡 Key Takeaways:

Learned the importance of maintaining proper node references during reversal.

Understood why Linked Lists are so powerful for dynamic data manipulation.

🔥 Next Step: Moving towards more advanced Linked List patterns like detecting cycles, merging lists, and implementing custom operations.
