ðŸš€ Day 18 of My 90 Days DSA with JavaScript Challenge! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥

Today was all about Linked Lists & String Manipulation! Hereâ€™s what I accomplished:

âœ… Linked List Operations

Creation of a Linked List

Deletion of nodes

addFirst() â€“ Insert at the beginning

addLast() â€“ Insert at the end

addAtIndex() â€“ Insert at a specific position

âœ… String Problem Solved

Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant â€“ Identifying which characters dominate in a given string.

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:

How pointers and references play a big role in Linked Lists.

Difference between arrays and linked lists in terms of memory and operations.

Frequency counting technique for solving string-related problems efficiently.

ðŸ”¥ Building these fundamentals gives a huge confidence boost for complex data structures and algorithmic patterns coming ahead.

ðŸ“… Tomorrowâ€™s Goal: Explore Doubly Linked Lists and start with Stacks implementation using Linked Lists!
