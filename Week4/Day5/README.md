Day X: The Ultimate Revision Day – Strengthening the Foundation!

Today was all about going back to the roots and reinforcing every concept I’ve learned so far. Rather than jumping into new problems, I dedicated the entire day to revising all the topics I have covered during this journey.

✅ What I Did Today:

Reviewed all Data Structures and Algorithms concepts I’ve practiced so far.

Revisited Linked Lists, Arrays, Strings, and Queue concepts.

Went through the problems I solved earlier (like Anagrams, Palindrome Linked List, Reverse Linked List, and others).

Re-analyzed my solutions and checked if there’s a better or more optimized approach.

Revised edge cases and complexity analysis for every solution.

🔍 Why Revision is Important:

Reinforces what you’ve learned so far and solidifies your concepts.

Helps you spot mistakes or inefficiencies in your previous solutions.

Prepares you for interviews where speed + accuracy matters.

💡 Tip of the Day:
"Don’t just write code; revisit it after some time. You’ll always find something to improve!"

🔮 Next Steps:
From tomorrow, I’ll start fresh topics and continue the journey stronger than ever!
