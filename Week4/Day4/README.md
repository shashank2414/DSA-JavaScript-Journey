✅ Day 25 of My Learning & Development Journey

💻 What I Did Today:
Today, I focused on payment gateway integration in my ongoing project TradeKing. Specifically, I worked on integrating PhonePe payment solutions to handle secure transactions. This included:
✔ Understanding PhonePe’s API flow (Standard Checkout, callbacks, transaction validation)
✔ Configuring test keys for UAT environment
✔ Implementing transaction ID generation in a dynamic format
✔ Setting up response handling to ensure success/failure is stored properly in the database

📚 What I Learned:

How merchant key & secret work in authentication.

Importance of checksum generation for secure transactions.

How to manage server-to-server communication for verifying payment status.

The role of transaction lifecycle in e-commerce systems.

🔁 Revision:

Revise HTTP request handling (POST, callbacks) in PHP or Node.js.

Revisit secure coding practices when dealing with payment APIs.

Understand asynchronous vs synchronous responses in API callbacks.

💡 Tip of the Day:
Always test your payment gateway in sandbox mode before moving to production. And never hardcode keys—use environment variables for security!

🎯 Next Steps:

Complete final integration testing with all edge cases.

Add retry logic for failed payments.

Work on user-friendly error handling for smooth UX.
