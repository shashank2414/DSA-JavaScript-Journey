ðŸš€ Day 17 â€“ String Problems: Reversal & Palindrome Checks
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Reverse String â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Valid Palindrome (Using Extra Space) â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Valid Palindrome (Two Pointer Approach) â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Reverse String:
â€¢ Implemented in-place reversal using two-pointer technique
â€¢ Swapped characters from start and end until pointers meet
â€¢ Complexity: O(n), space: O(1)

ðŸ”‘ Valid Palindrome (Extra Space):
â€¢ Converted string to lowercase, removed non-alphanumeric characters
â€¢ Checked if the cleaned string equals its reverse
â€¢ Simpler approach but requires O(n) extra space

ðŸ”‘ Valid Palindrome (Two Pointer):
â€¢ Used two pointers: one from start, one from end
â€¢ Skipped non-alphanumeric characters and compared remaining
â€¢ More space-efficient (O(1) extra space) and still O(n) time

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Mastered two-pointer technique for both reversal and palindrome problems
â€¢ Understood trade-offs between extra space vs in-place solutions
â€¢ Reinforced knowledge of string preprocessing (removing unwanted characters)

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
For palindrome problems, always think: â€œCan I avoid extra space with two pointer
