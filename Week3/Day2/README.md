ðŸš€ Day 16 â€“ String Problems: Jewels & Balanced Splits
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Jewels and Stones â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Split a String in Balanced Strings â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Jewels and Stones:
â€¢ Given two strings: jewels (types of jewels) and stones (stones you have)
â€¢ Count how many stones are also jewels
â€¢ Approaches:
â€ƒâœ” Use a set for jewels for O(1) lookup and loop through stones
â€ƒâœ” Complexity: O(n + m)

ðŸ”‘ Split a String in Balanced Strings:
â€¢ A string is balanced if it contains an equal number of L and R
â€¢ Traverse the string, maintain a balance counter:
â€ƒ- Increment for L, decrement for R
â€ƒ- Whenever balance = 0, it means a balanced substring is found
â€¢ Complexity: O(n), single pass

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Practiced hash-based lookup (sets) for fast membership testing
â€¢ Understood how to use counters for balance-related problems
â€¢ Improved skills in single-pass string processing

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
When a problem asks for balanced partitions, think of using a counter instead of substring operations â€” itâ€™s cleaner and faster.
