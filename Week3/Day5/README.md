ðŸš€ Day 19 â€“ String Problems: Palindrome & Isomorphic Mapping
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Valid Palindrome â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Isomorphic Strings â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Valid Palindrome:
â€¢ Normalize by lowercasing and skipping non-alphanumeric characters
â€¢ Use two pointers from both ends; move inward while comparing
â€¢ Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space (two-pointer approach)

ðŸ”‘ Isomorphic Strings:
â€¢ Maintain two maps: s â†’ t and t â†’ s to ensure one-to-one mapping
â€¢ As you scan, verify existing mappings; if conflict, return false
â€¢ Complexity: O(n) time, O(k) space (k = unique chars)

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Practiced string normalization and clean two-pointer patterns
â€¢ Reinforced bijection (one-to-one) mapping for pattern-matching problems
â€¢ Noted how early exits save time on mismatches

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
For isomorphic checks, never rely on a single mapâ€”always verify both directions to prevent many-to-one collisions.
