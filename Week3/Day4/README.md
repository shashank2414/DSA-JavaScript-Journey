ðŸš€ Day 18 â€“ String Problems: Prefix & Odd Number Extraction
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Largest Odd Number in String â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Longest Common Prefix â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Largest Odd Number in String:
â€¢ Traverse the string from the end to find the last odd digit
â€¢ Return substring from start to that digit
â€¢ Complexity: O(n), space: O(1)

ðŸ”‘ Longest Common Prefix:
â€¢ Sort the strings or use vertical scanning
â€¢ Compare characters until mismatch is found
â€¢ Complexity: O(n * m) where n = number of strings, m = length of shortest string

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Practiced string scanning and substring operations efficiently
â€¢ Learned different strategies for common prefix problems (sorting vs character comparison)
â€¢ Understood the importance of minimizing iterations for large inputs

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
When dealing with prefixes, comparing the first and last strings after sorting often simplifies the logic.
