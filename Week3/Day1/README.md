ðŸš€ Day 15 â€“ Strings: Basics & Problem Solving
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ String Concepts â€“ Understanding immutability, indexing, iteration
â€¢ Length of Last Word â€“ Solved with both one-loop and two-loop approaches
â€¢ Find Words Containing Characters â€“ Filtering words based on character presence

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ String Concepts:
â€¢ Learned that strings are immutable â€“ operations create new strings instead of modifying in place
â€¢ Practiced common operations: slicing, concatenation, case conversion, trimming

ðŸ”‘ Length of Last Word:
â€¢ One Loop: Traverse from the end, skip trailing spaces, count until a space is found
â€¢ Two Loop: First trim spaces, then iterate from the last character until a space
â€¢ Complexity: O(n)

ðŸ”‘ Find Words Containing Characters:
â€¢ Iterate through each word, check if it contains the target character(s)
â€¢ Used string methods (includes, indexOf) or manual character scanning
â€¢ Good practice for nested iteration and condition checking

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Improved string traversal skills and handling of edge cases (extra spaces, punctuation)
â€¢ Learned multiple approaches to the same problem, choosing based on readability vs efficiency
â€¢ Practiced filtering and searching inside strings

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
When solving string problems, try to visualize them like array problems â€” both are sequences and can be processed similarly.
