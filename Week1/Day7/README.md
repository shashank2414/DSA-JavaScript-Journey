ðŸš€ Day 7 â€“ Merge Sort & Two Sum
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Merge Sort â€“ Implemented from scratch
â€¢ Two Sum â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Merge Sort:
A classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
â€¢ Recursively divide the array into halves
â€¢ Merge them back in sorted order
â€¢ Time: O(n log n)
â€¢ Space: O(n)
ðŸ’¡ Preferred for sorting large datasets efficiently.

ðŸ”‘ Two Sum:
Find two numbers that add up to a target.
â€¢ Used a hash map to store the complement and check in a single pass
â€¢ Time: O(n)
â€¢ Space: O(n)
âœ… Practiced real-world thinking â€” like finding a pair of expenses that match a gift card balance.

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Understood how recursive sorting works under the hood with merge sort.
â€¢ Strengthened skills with hash maps for fast lookups in array problems.
â€¢ Reinforced use of problem patterns like "two-pointer" and "complement lookup."

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
When solving problems like Two Sum, always think: Can I trade space for time using a hash map? It can turn O(nÂ²) into O(n).
