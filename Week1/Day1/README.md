# 🚀 Day 1 – [Second Largest in Array, Palindrome Check, Reverse Integer]

📎 Second Largest in Array : https://lnkd.in/gyDTFNR7
🔑 Second Largest in Array: Retrieve all numbers from original array, get the max from new array,
   compare other elements if it is less than max, if less put it into a variable and update this variable through the entire array.

📎 Palindrome Check : https://lnkd.in/gmN7U8mw
 🔑 Palindrome Check: Focus on comparing characters from both ends, if you get completed till (low<=high) without breaking of loop, it is palindrome otherwise not.

📎 Reverse Integer : https://lnkd.in/gZWsM3Ev
 🔑 Reverse Integer: Just get out single single integer from last digit, store it in new array and print it.

 💡 Tip of the Day: Don’t jump to code! First build your intuition. Most problems have patterns — identify them.
