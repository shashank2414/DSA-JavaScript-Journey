ðŸš€ Day 5 â€“ Single Number, Binary Search, Linear Search
âœ… Problems Solved:
â€¢ Single Number â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Binary Search â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Linear Search â€“ Practice

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Single Number:
Leverage the power of XOR:
â€¢ a ^ a = 0, a ^ 0 = a
XOR all elements â€“ duplicates cancel out, and you're left with the unique number in O(n) time, O(1) space.

ðŸ”‘ Binary Search:
Classic divide-and-conquer approach. Use two pointers (low, high) to repeatedly halve the search space.
Efficient for sorted arrays, with time complexity O(log n).

ðŸ”‘ Linear Search:
Simple and intuitive â€“ loop through the array and compare each element.
Best for unsorted or small datasets. Time complexity O(n).

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Mastered the use of bitwise XOR for unique element problems.
â€¢ Practiced applying binary search logic with proper mid-point calculation.
â€¢ Compared binary vs linear search to understand when each is most effective.

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
When dealing with sorted arrays, always ask: "Can I use binary search?" â€” it's a game changer for performance.
