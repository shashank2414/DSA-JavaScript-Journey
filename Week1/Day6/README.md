ðŸš€ Day 6 â€“ Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
âœ… Concepts Practiced:
â€¢ Bubble Sort
â€¢ Insertion Sort
â€¢ Selection Sort

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Bubble Sort:
Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Each pass pushes the largest element to the end like a bubble rising to the top.
â€¢ Time: O(nÂ²)
â€¢ Best when the array is almost sorted

ðŸ”‘ Insertion Sort:
Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
â€¢ Good for small or partially sorted arrays
â€¢ Time: O(nÂ²), but O(n) for nearly sorted data

ðŸ”‘ Selection Sort:
Find the minimum element from the unsorted part and move it to the beginning.
â€¢ Simple, but inefficient for large data sets
â€¢ Time: O(nÂ²)

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Understood how basic sorting algorithms work under the hood.
â€¢ Reinforced use of loops and conditionals for sorting logic.
â€¢ Practiced writing sorting code from scratch to improve logic building.

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Before jumping to advanced sorting algorithms, mastering the basics like bubble, selection, and insertion helps build strong foundations.
