# ðŸš€ Day 2 â€“ Remove Duplicates, Remove Element, Reverse String

## âœ… Problems Solved:
- [x] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array â€“ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
- [x] Remove Element â€“ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)
- [x] Reverse String â€“ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

 ðŸ”‘ Remove Duplicates: Use two pointers â€” one to explore, one to place unique values. Use of XOR. (a^a = 0, a^0=a)

 ðŸ”‘ Remove Element: Shift non-target values forward and return the new length.

 ðŸ”‘ Reverse String: Swap each element with the help of while loop. while(low<=high). In-place reversal using the classic two-pointer swap.

## ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
- Realized the power of the two-pointer technique in modifying arrays in-place.
- Practiced thinking in terms of index manipulation rather than creating new arrays.
- Reinforced understanding of how in-place changes work in memory.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
> *Most array problems can be cracked with the right pointer strategy â€” think before you loop!*
