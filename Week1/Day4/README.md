â€¢ Max Consecutive Ones â€“ LeetCode
â€¢ Missing Number â€“ LeetCode

ðŸ§  Revise your logic

ðŸ”‘ Move Zeroes:
Use two pointers â€” one to iterate and one to track the position of non-zero elements.
After shifting all non-zero values, fill the rest with zeroes.

ðŸ”‘ Max Consecutive Ones:
Simple counter-based approach. Reset counter at each zero, and track the maximum streak of 1s.

ðŸ”‘ Missing Number:
Use the mathematical formula for the sum of first n natural numbers:
sum = n*(n+1)/2 and subtract the sum of actual array elements.
Alternative: XOR trick â€” XOR all indices and values to cancel out and get the missing number.

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Reinforced understanding of in-place updates and value shifting in arrays.
â€¢ Learned the use of XOR and Math formulas for efficient missing number detection.
â€¢ Practiced identifying optimal solutions with O(n) time and O(1) space.

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
Use mathematical intuition or XOR when you're looking for a single missing element in a range â€” it's faster and cleaner than sorting or using extra space.
