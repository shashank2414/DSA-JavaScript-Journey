ðŸ”‘ Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:
Track the minimum price so far while iterating, and calculate max profit at each step as current_price - min_price.
ðŸ’¡ Greedy approach works best here. One pass, constant space.

ðŸ”‘ Merge Sorted Array:
Use two pointers starting from the end of both arrays to fill the larger array backward.
Avoid extra space â€“ merge in-place from the end to avoid overwriting.

ðŸ“Œ Learnings:
â€¢ Learned how to optimize array problems by thinking backwards for in-place operations.
â€¢ Reinforced the greedy pattern in stock problems.
â€¢ Got more confident with pointer-based strategies and reducing space complexity.

ðŸ’¡ Tip of the Day:
When working in-place with sorted arrays, try filling from the back to avoid shifting elements unnecessarily.
